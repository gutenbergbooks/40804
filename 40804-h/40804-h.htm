<h3>
<span>SOUTH SEA PLAYING CARDS.</span>
</h3>

<p>It is pretty generally known that, during the South Sea mania, a pack of
playing cards was published in illustration of the prevailing folly.
Each card contained a caricature of one of the numerous bubble
companies, with a pertinent verse underneath. These cards are now
extremely rare. I never saw a complete set, nor do I know where one is
to be found. Some time ago a friend kindly furnished me with a copy of
all the verses (except one), and as I am not aware that they have been
printed separately, I beg to forward a transcript for preservation in
"N. &amp; Q.;" not because I think they have any excellence to recommend
them, but because it is desirable that so curious a record of a very
extraordinary time should not be entirely lost.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of your correspondents can supply the missing verse:&mdash;</p>

<h3>
<span>BIRTHPLACE OF THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE.</span>
</h3>

<p>It is commonly believed that the Island of Martinique was the birthplace
of Marie Josephine Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, better known as the
Empress Josephine. It would seem, however, from the following
circumstances, that St. Lucia has a preferable claim to that
distinction. By the treaty of Paris (10th February, 1763), St. Lucia,
until then one of the neutral islands, was ceded to France, and was made
a dependency of Martinique. The first step adopted by the local
authorities on that occasion, was to offer extensive grants of land in
St. Lucia to such families in Martinique as might be disposed to settle
in the former island; and among those who took advantage of the proposal
was M. de Tascher, the father of Josephine. In the course of the year
1763 he came over to St. Lucia, and settled with his family on the crest
of a hill called <i>Paix-Bouche</i>, within a few miles of the site now
occupied by the principal town. Here they continued to reside until
1771, when M. de Tascher, having been selected for the office of
President of the <i>Conseil Souverain</i> in Martinique, returned with his
family to that island, taking with him a child seven years old, to whom
Madame de Tascher had given birth at <i>Morne Paix-Bouche</i> on the 24th
June, 1764, and who was destined to become the wife of Bonaparte and the
Empress of France.</p>

<p>The fact that M. de Tascher and his family settled in St. Lucia after
the Treaty of Paris, is too well established to require corroboration.
The fact that his residence there extended from 1763 to 1771, is no less
certain. While collecting materials some years ago for the history of
St. Lucia, I met with the most authentic proofs of this circumstance;
but having returned the books and documents to the several parties to
whom they belonged, I am unable at this moment to give a special
reference under this head. As regards the particular date of
Mademoiselle De Tascher's birth, I am indebted for a knowledge of it to
no less an authority than M. Sidney Daney, the author of a voluminous
history of Martinique, who, while asserting that she was born on the
paternal estate in that island, records the date in the following words:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Cette année 1764 fut signalée par la naissance d'une femme qui,
   tout en parvenant à la plus glorieuse des destinées humaines,
   devait être à la fois le symbole le plus doux de cette divine
   charité. Le vingt-quatre Juin naquit aux Trois-Ilets, sur
   l'habitation de ses parens, Marie Josephine Rose Tascher de la
   Pagerie."</p>

<p>That the claim of St. Lucia to the honour of having given birth to that
remarkable woman is no idle dream, no imaginary pretension, now set up
for the first time, can be shown by many circumstances. From her
coronation in 1804, to her death in 1814, there were several persons in
St. Lucia who asserted their knowledge of the fact. Some of them were
still living in 1825, when the late Sir John Jeremie came to St. Lucia
and collected information on the subject. In 1831 that able judge
published in a local newspaper a short historical notice of St. Lucia,
in which he gives the following unequivocal testimony on this question.
I quote from the <i>St. Lucia Gazette and Public Advertiser</i> of 23rd
February, 1831:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "On the summit of one of its (St. Lucia's) highest mountains, the
   <i>Paix-Bouche</i> (a word which in Negro-French is significantly
   expressive of silence), on a spot surrounded by trees, apparently
   the growth of centuries, it might be supposed that here at least
   the very name of the extraordinary being who has given an impulse
   to the age of Napoleon had scarcely reached. A few yards from the
   almost impracticable and faintly traced path is the mouldering
   foundation of a decayed cottage. <i>That was the birthplace of
   Josephine.</i> The inhabitants of Martinique, with whom all the St.
   Lucia families are connected, lay claim to Josephine as their
   countrywoman. The fact is, however, as I have stated it; and this
   was admitted by one of her own family at Martinique to a lady of
   our island, but with the truly French addition, 'qu'elle n'avait
   fait qu'y naître.' The companion of her childhood was Mr. Martin
   Raphael, late a councillor of the royal court, who is still
   living, and who on visiting France was kindly received by her at
   Malmaison. Madame Delomel, who died but a few months ago at a
   very advanced age, knew her well."</p>

<p>On my arrival in St. Lucia in 1831, an old woman of colour, named
<i>Dédé</i>, was pointed out to me as having been in the service of the
Taschers at <i>Morne Paix-Bouche</i>. She was then residing with the family
of Mr. R. Juge, the President of the Court of First Instance, and that
gentleman assured me that nothing was more certain than that Josephine
was born in St. Lucia. I afterwards had several conversations with
<i>Dédé</i> on the subject, and she confirmed Mr. Juge's statement, adding
that she was present at the time of Josephine's<a id="Page_221"></a> <span class="pagenum">[221]</span> birth, and was
employed as her <i>bonne</i> until the departure of the family for
Martinique. <i>Dédé</i> was an intelligent old dame, then about eighty years
of age, and was greatly respected by every one.</p>

<p>I am aware that all this is at variance with the biographical records of
our time, which assign Martinique as the place of Josephine's birth. But
this inaccuracy may be accounted for on the following grounds. 1st. St.
Lucia is within a short distance of Martinique, and at the period of
Josephine's birth was a dependency, a portion, as it were, of that
colony. 2nd. The family had long been settled in Martinique before they
came to St. Lucia, and all their predilections were for the former
island. 3rd. Their sojourn in St. Lucia was not of long duration, and in
a few years the circumstance of their having been there at all was
probably forgotten by the public. 4th. There was no priest in St. Lucia
in 1764, by whom the child might have been christened, and the place of
her birth established beyond dispute. 5th. When at a subsequent period
she was baptized in Martinique, it happened naturally enough that there
was no one present who had any knowledge of her having been born in St.
Lucia, or who felt any concern in the matter. 6th. M. De Tascher had now
become a personage of some distinction, and he was probably not
unwilling to efface the recollection of his having been, at one time, a
needy planter in the wilds of St. Lucia. 7th. Facts which have since
acquired an obvious importance, were of none at all in 1771. The
suppression of such a circumstance, whether intentional or accidental,
would have attracted no notice at that period of the history of the
Taschers. It was not then anticipated that a member of the family would,
at no very remote period, become associated with the greatest actor in
the most extraordinary revolution in the world's history, and prove
herself not unworthy of so exalted a destiny.</p>

<p>All that relates to the Empress Josephine receives an added degree of
interest from recent occurrences. It would be strange if the wife who
was discarded by Napoleon because she could not give him an heir for the
imperial throne, should give him, if not an heir, his first successor,
in the person of her grandson, Prince Louis Napoleon. As regards St.
Lucia, too, there is a coincidence which may be worth mentioning. When
Napoleon fell into our hands after the battle of Waterloo, St. Lucia was
the place <i>first</i> selected for his exile; but in consequence of the
dangers likely to arise frown its proximity to Martinique, the scheme
was relinquished, and the preference given to St. Helena.</p>

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON HOMER, NO. III.<br />
(<i>Continued from</i> Vol. v., p. 172.)</span>
</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Lachmann and Grote. New Views.</i></p>

<p>Agreeably to my promise at the conclusion of my former article, I
continue and conclude my remarks on the Homeric question.</p>

<p>Nitzsch, one of Wolf's most indefatigable and learned opponents,
examined his theory with the closest critical nicety, and, by proving
its fallaciousness, he shook the stability of it very much&mdash;not wholly,
however, because disproof does not always engender disbelief; scholars
were beginning to lose faith therein, when, ten years ago, the late Carl
Lachmann revived it, with certain modifications, in his <i>Fernere
Betrachtungen über die Ilias</i> (Abhandl. Berlin. Acad. 1841), where he
has proposed the following views:&mdash;</p>

<p>That the Homeric poems were not composed by one man, but by several,
working together; and that, after the collection of these lays by
Peisistratos, the history of them is precisely as given us by classical
writers.</p>

<p>This proposition, to use the words of Grote,<a id="rote1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else;" and is
further refuted by the actual facts of the poems themselves,<a id="elves2"></a><a title="Go to footnote 2." href="#fn2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where,
as we find, no contradictions bearing on this point occur, and the whole
sixteen poets (for such is Lachmann's number) concur in killing and
sending off the stage, so to speak, these considerable chieftains (and
all in the first battle after the secession of Achilles), Elephenor,
chief of the Eub&oelig;ans,<a id="ans3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Tlepolemos,
of the Rhodians;<a id="ians4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Pandaros of
the Lycians;<a id="cians5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Odios, of
 the Halizonians;<a id="nians6"></a><a title="Go to footnote 6." href="#fn6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Pirous and Acamas, of the
Thracians;<a id="acians7"></a><a title="Go to footnote 7." href="#fn7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> besides many of inferior note. None of these reappear in
the whole course of the work; and it seems strange, as Mure continues,
that "any number of 'independent poets' should have so harmoniously
dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel." And he then cites
the solitary discrepancy, Pylæmenes, as the only exception,<a id="tion8"></a><a title="Go to footnote 8." href="#fn8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> whose
death is related in the fifth, and who weeps at his son's funeral in the
thirteenth book. This however, Mure explains as an oversight on the part
of the poet (which is, however, <i>impossible</i>), or to the more probable
cause of an interpolation of verses 658 and 659 by an early rhapsodist,
"better versed in the 'Battle of the Ships,' as his habitual part in the

   wavering in respect to these supposed primary atoms.... I will
   add in respect to his [Lachmann's] dissertations, so instructive
   as a microscopic examination of the poem, 1. That I find myself
   constantly dissenting from that critical feeling on the strength
   of which he cuts out parts as interpolations, and discovers
   traces of the hands of distinct poets: 2. That his objections
   against the continuity of the narrative are often founded upon
   lines which the ancient scholiasts and Mr. Payne Knight had
   already pronounced to be interpolations: 3. That such of his
   objections as are founded upon lines undisputed admit, in many

<p>Grote's own opinions on the subject are difficult to arrive at, but what
he <i>has</i> said is mostly true. These three different views of the Homeric
controversy have, as I have said, occupied the world since thinking on
the subject began; each hypothesis has found most able, critical, and
quibbling adherents and opponents, each affirming and proving, after his
own way, what the others denied and scouted.</p>

<p>There is another author who has likewise discussed the subject of Homer,
and in a way more attractive to the general reader; and that is the
finely-feeling and learned Walter Savage Landor, in his <i>Pericles and
Aspasia</i>. Speaking in the person of Pericles, he says:&mdash;<a id="says10"></a><a title="Go to footnote 10." href="#fn10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> </p>

<p class="blockquot"> "I have no paradox to maintain, no partiality to defend. Some
   tell us there were twenty Homers; some deny that there was ever
   one. <i>It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in
   order to let them settle at last.</i> We are perpetually labouring
   to destroy our delights, our composure, our devotion to superior
   power. Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for
   us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our admiration of
   good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do. He was the
   only author I read when I was a boy; for our teachers are usually
   of opinion that wisdom and poetry are, like fruits for children,
   unwholesome, if too fresh. Simonides had indeed grown somewhat
   sound; Pindar was heating; Æschylus ... ay, but Æschylus was
   almost at the next door. Homer then nourished my fancy, animated
   my dreams, awoke me in the morning, marched with me, sailed with
   me, taught me morals, taught me language, taught me music, and
   philosophy, and war."</p>

p. 387.</p>

<p>Agreeing with my honoured friend in what I have italicised above, I
think it is time that the Homeric question were set at rest, and, to
atone for our error in shaking the vase, let it remain at peace forever.
I offer my reflections on the subject with extreme diffidence, yet,
though I confess myself open to correction, and desirous of it, as a
friend to literature, I cannot say that I think my views will be found
far from an approximation to the truth, which, at this remote age, is
all we can possibly arrive at. As Plinius Secundus held that there was
no book so bad but that something might be learned from it, so I hold
that there is no theory so bad (always excepting that one put forth by
some escaped Bedlamite, of Shakspeare's non-being, and that his works
were the composition of the monks), but that there lies some truth at
the bottom of it. On that principle I have endeavoured "to lay the keel"
(as Southey used to say of his planned poems) of a reconciliation
between all the beliefs of all the theorists.</p>

<p>I will state my theory, as I have done the others, in the plainest
possible terms; and, to begin at the beginning, I must go back to the
origin of song. Is it possible that an army like that of the Hellenes
when at Troy, had no idea of passing the weary evenings except in
drinking and talking? No: surely not. We find Phemios singing, in the
<i>Odyssea</i>, lays of much the same kidney as those in Athenæos, and in
Xenophon's <i>Symposion</i>. These were short recitals of some particular
circumstance of antiquity, half religious and half earthly. No doubt the
common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors of some fifty
years ago, some one qualified to "discourse in excellent music" among
them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the United States,
were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing around them. But
what was passing around them? The grand events of a spirit-stirring war;
occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the mystical legends of
former times had done, upon their memory; besides which, a retentive
memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and was cultivated
accordingly, in those ancient times. Ballads at first, and down to the
beginning of the war with Troy, were mere recitations with an
intonation. Then followed a species of recitative, probably with an
intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the memory considerably.</p>

<p>It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a
poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Meonides, but most
probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great
utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
Hellas, and as a collection he published these lays, connecting them by
a tale of his own. This poem now exists under the title of the
<i>Odyssea</i>. The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,
which, in fact, was great part of it remodelled from the archaïc dialect
of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He therefore
called it the poem of <i>Homeros</i>, or the Collector.<a id="ector11"></a><a title="Go to footnote 11." href="#fn11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But this is
rather a<a id="Page_223"></a> <span class="pagenum">[223]</span> proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere
drudging arrangement of other people's ideas, for, as Grote has finely
observed, arguing for the unity of authorship, "a great poet might have
recast pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no
mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so."<a id="so12"></a><a title="Go to footnote 12." href="#fn12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

 as the author, but as the arranger and compiler of the Vedas and the
 Purânas. His name dates his character, meaning the <i>arranger</i> or
 <i>distributor</i>; and the recurrence of so many Vyasas,&mdash;many individuals
 who new-modelled the Hindu Scriptures,&mdash;has nothing in it that is
 improbable, except the fabulous intervals by which their labours are
 separated."</p>

<p>While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad
recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon; his noble mind seized
the hint that there presented itself, and the <i>Achilleïs</i><a id="achill13"></a><a title="Go to footnote 13." href="#fn13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> grew under
his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the poem under
the same pseudonyme as his former work; and the disjointed lays of the
ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to the Cid, into
a chronicle history, named the <i>Iliad</i>.<a id="liad14"></a><a title="Go to footnote 14." href="#fn14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Melesigenes knew that the
poem was destined to be a lasting one; and so it has proved. But first,
the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions, by
the people who took to singing them in the streets, assemblies, and
agoras. However, Solon first, and then Peisistratos, and afterwards
Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored the works of
Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great measure. But
that this was of no great avail is evident from the corruption <span title="[Greek: oiônoisi te pasi]">&#959;&#7984;&#969;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#963;&#8055; &#964;&#949; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;</span>, in the opening. <i>All</i> birds are not carnivorous, and
therefore the passage must be wrong: besides, the words immediately
following, savouring somewhat of interpolation, and, indeed, being
condemned by some as such, would lead to the fair assumption that the
whole line was corrupted.</p>

<p>I said before (Vol. v., p. 99.) that the Cyclic poems illustrated the
history of the Homeric compositions, just as the letters of Poplicola,
and those of Philo Junius, illustrate the history of Junius; but I am
not inclined to deprive them all of credit as the compositions of the
same poet. For instance, part of the
<span title="[Greek: Ilias mikra]">&#921;&#955;&#953;&#945;&#962; &#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#945;</span> was probably
done from the notes of Melesigenes, who was, like Herodotos, always at
work upon some matter.</p>

<p>The origin of writing has been made a stumbling-block in the Homeric
question, and most foolishly; and I must again agree with Colonel Mure
on this subject. Mr. Grote, Mr. Granville Penn, and the Colonel, have
done more for the elucidation of the question than any other scholars of
the present or last age; and it is to them we must turn for further
assistance. I wish they would give their attention to the hymns,
especially that to Hermes; for "thereby hangs a tale."</p>

<p>As for me, I leave my speculations to the mercy of those who do not
think like myself. I am satisfied that they are not far from the truth,
and as near as we can hope to come in these days. Indeed, it is a
well-known fact, embodied in the old proverb, "What's one man's meat's
another's poison;" and that which is convincing to one is the contrary
to another.</p>

<span><i>Ancient Custom on Interment.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;I have read that it was a custom to
inter an hour-glass with the deal, as an emblem of the sand of life
being run out; or perhaps (as I should rather suggest) to intimate that
the departed, having entered upon eternity, had done with time. I
believe that in the early part of the last century the custom had not
entirely disappeared, and that small hour-glasses were given to the
friends of the deceased attending at funerals, and were put beside the
corpse (like rosemary), or thrown into the grave? Does the custom still
linger in any remote parts of the country?</p>

<h3>
<span>SAINTED KINGS INCORRUPTIBLE.</span>
</h3>

<p>In the Appendix to Evelyn's interesting <i>Diary</i> (last edition, 1850),
your readers may recollect<a id="Page_224"></a> <span class="pagenum">[224]</span> there is a note upon the "unexpected
finding the crucifix and gold chain of that pious prince, St. Edward the
Confessor." The note contains an extract from the narrative of the
circumstances attending the finding of those relics by "Charles Taylour,
Gent." (or, Henry Keepe&mdash;the writer's correct name). It appears from
that account, that when, in 1163, Thomas à Becket obtained a
canonisation of the king, and the coffin was opened, the body was found
uncorrupted; and that, 136 years after William I. had commanded the
coffin to be enshrined, when the abbot resolved to inspect the body,
then likewise "said to be incorruptible," he found it so, "being
perfect, the limbs flexible," &amp;c.</p>

<p>A curious parallel to this presented itself recently to one in the
course of a reference to the 2nd volume of Mr. W. B. MacCabe's curious
and laborious <i>Catholic History of England</i>. [<i>En passant</i>, allow me to
express the hope, in which I well know many sympathise, that the
long-promised <i>third</i> volume, bringing the history down to the accession
of William the Conqueror, will ere long appear. The work gives in a
well-arranged form so much that is curious in our early national
records, that it would be a matter of regret that it should not be
completed. It is a great pity indeed that the author's original plan, to
carry the history down to the Reformation, should have been abandoned.]
After describing the burial of Edgar (also a "Confessor," as well as St.
Edward), it is stated that "in the year 1052, upon his tomb being opened
by the Abbot Eilward, his body was found perfectly <i>free from</i> the
slightest stain of <i>corruption</i>;" and that upon the body being
"profanely hacked," in order to make it fit the receptacle prepared for
it, "torrents of blood burst from the king's corpse." (W. Malmsb. <i>Ges.
Reg. Ang.</i>) This, be it remembered, was eighty-seven years after burial.
The body was afterwards deposited in a shrine. Are there other examples
mentioned by the chroniclers of the incorruptibility of saintly kings?
Both Edward and Edgar were, it should be recollected, good friends to
the monks. William of Malmsbury, in the course of his eulogium upon
Edgar, mentions the important fact that the monarch not only gave&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">but also&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Templis Monachos, Monachis dedit agros."</p>

</div>

<p>Were not these strong reasons why the king should remain uncorrupted, at
all events in the memory, and also the records, of the brotherhood?</p>

of his son Benjamin. Although the tree still marks the spot, the house
itself does not now stand; it was razed to the ground some years since
to make room for the present buildings. Benjamin's brother, who was
afterwards Archbishop of Dublin, was also born in this house. I may add
that this is not generally known in the town, but I think the above

<span><i>Junius and the Quarterly Review again.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The article on the Letters of
Junius, in the last number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, is very pleasantly
written. But I suppose it will not be considered to have rendered
probable the notion that Thomas Lord Lyttelton was the writer of those
letters. The reviewer observes that "Lord Lyttelton," meaning George,
the first Lord Lyttelton, is only once mentioned by Junius. Undoubtedly
Junius mentions "Lord <i>Littleton's</i> integrity and judgment" (Woodfall,
ii. 305.) Can it be imagined that Thomas Lord <i>Lyttelton</i> could have so
mis-spelled his father's name?</p>

<h3>
<span>SEVEN QUERIES.</span>
</h3>



<p>1. On the 24th February, 1831, was published, at Speenhamland, the first
number of the <i>History and Antiquities of Newbury and its Environs</i>. Was
this work ever completed? If not, how many numbers were issued.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">["The History and Antiquities of Newbury and its Environs,
   including twenty-eight Parishes situate in the County of Berks,
   also a Catalogue of Plants found in the Neighbourhood," was
   completed in 1839, and makes a volume of 340 pages.]</p>


<p>2. Can any information be given as to Hannah Woolley beyond what she
gives in the curious autobiographical sketch prefixed to her
<i>Gentlewoman's Companion, or a Guide to the Female Sex</i>; 3rd edition.
London, 1682, 12mo. Her maiden name she omits to mention; and all she
discloses as to her family and fortunes is, that her parents died when
she was very young, and that she had suffered "all manner of
affliction," "by loss of husband, children, friend, estate."</p>

<p>3. Amongst Mr. C. K. Sharpe's MSS. was sold <i>The Force of Love, or the
Ephesian Matron; a Dramatick Poem, in Three Parts</i>. From a playbill,
which was pasted on the fly-leaf, it seems that this drama was produced
for the benefit of Mr. and Mrs. Wallace, at the theatre in Sadler
Street, Durham, April 7, 1777. The performance was "gratis;" but 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>, 2<i>s.</i>, and 1<i>s.</i>, for boxes, pit, and gallery, were charged for
the "Concert of Music." The title was changed into the <i>Matron of
Ephesus</i>, and the authorship was ascribed to Mr. Wallace. No notice
either of play or author occurs in the <i>Biographia Dramatica</i>.</p>

<p>4. Does any MS. of the <i>Conquest of China</i>, a tragedy, by Sir Robert
Howard, exist? I have in my library a scene written by the Earl of
Rochester for the author, and which, so far as I can trace, from the
very defective state of the libraries of the north, was never printed.
It is a beautiful MS., and some of the lines possess considerable
vigour. It is written in rhyme.</p>

<p>5. Who was the author of the <i>History of Faction, alias Hypocrisy, alias
Moderation, from its first Rise, down to its present Toleration in these
Kingdoms</i>? &amp;c. London, 1705, 8vo.<a id="Page_226"></a> <span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>6. Where can the fourth and concluding(?) number of Wright's <i>History of
Ludlow</i> be obtained?</p>

 <p class="blockquot">[Only three Parts have been published. The last was issued in
   1847.]</p>


<p>7. Can you inform me who was the translator of&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">   "<i>The Idea of Christian Love</i>; being a Translation, at the
   Instance of Mr. Waller, of a Latin Sermon upon John xiii. 34,
   35., preached by Mr. Edward Young, Prebend of Salisbury. With a
   large Paraphrase on Mr. Waller's Poem of <i>Divine Love</i>. To which
   are added, some Copies of Verses from that excellent Poetess Mrs.
   Wharton, with others to her. London, 1688, 8vo."</p>


<p>The versification is extremely good, but as I never saw the sermon, I
can have no notion whether the translation be faithful, or the reverse.
I suspect a Latin "preachment" would have few hearers, especially
now-a-days: but it would be interesting to see a Latin sermon which
Waller thought highly of, and which he proposed should be turned into
verse.</p>

<p>I have not been able to procure any information as to the sermon, or its
poetical translation, in any bibliographical work; but perhaps some of
your numerous readers may know something either about Mr. Edward Young,
the father I presume of the poet, or the translator.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wharton was the daughter of Sir H. Lee, of Ditchly, and the first
wife of the future Marquis of Wharton. A manuscript tragedy by her, and
in her own handwriting, is in my possession. It is the presentation copy
to Miss Mary Howe, whose autograph is on the fly-leaf. It is beautifully
bound in old morocco, and formerly belonged to Horace Walpole, whose
book-plate is on it. Who was Miss Mary Howe? It was purchased at the
dispersion of the curious MSS. of Mr. Charles K. Sharpe, who had a great
fancy for the lady's poetry. She is erroneously styled Marchioness of
Wharton in Park's edition of Walpole's <i>Royal and Noble Authors</i>.</p>

   Upham in Hampshire, Prebendary of Salisbury, and lastly Dean of
   that church. He died in 1705. The translation and paraphrase in
   <i>The Idea of Christian Love</i> is attributed to William Atwood in
   the Bodleian Catalogue.]</p>



<h3>
<span>PLAGUE STONES.</span>
</h3>

<p>In a recent and valuable report addressed to the General Board of
Health, on the sanitary state of the borough of Dorchester, by a
gentleman to whom I, in common with all the readers of "N. &amp; Q.," have
often been indebted&mdash;I mean Robert Rawlinson, Esq.,&mdash;an allusion is made
to the existence of "Plague Stones" in different parts of the country.
Briefly recording the principal visitations of plague in Dorchester and
its neighbourhood, he describes these "plague stones" as "stones placed
on the boundary limits of old towns, having a circular or square
dish-like sinking in them, which was filled with water, into which the
town's people dropped the purchase-money in their dealings with the
country people, as was supposed, to prevent infection. <i>Such stones may
be seen in many places throughout England.</i>" The object of this
communication is, to suggest the propriety of a list of these curious
relics being made, through the medium of your excellent paper. I am not
aware of any such list at present existing. A plague stone is to be
seen, I believe, at Penrith; and another near Manchester, which is, I am
told, called the "Giant's Stone." The name of the latter seems, to my
mind, to point to a more remote period, unless an existing monument of
antiquity bearing that title was during the times of plague converted to
the temporary use of receiving the suspected money in the hollowed dish,
which is made at the top of these "plague stones." By the way, might not
our forefathers have suffered less from the fearful visitations and
devastating epidemics to which so many hundreds of thousands of them
fell victims, if they had been as careful to <i>wash themselves</i>
habitually in <i>aqua pura</i> as they were to wash the money which they
received from suspected localities. The custom above alluded to admitted
the powerfully cleansing qualities of water. It would have been good for
them, especially in trying times of plague, if they had not been so
accustomed to "let" the "<i>well</i> alone," as regards their own personal
purification.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Sir James Hayes, of Bedgebury, Kent.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;It is mentioned in the
<i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, 1792, p. 21., that on the foundation stone of
Old Bedgebury House in Kent, was found, many years ago, an inscription
recording the building of that house in 1688 by Sir James Hayes, and
Rachel Viscountess Falkland, his wife. Allusion is made in the
inscription to his having attained <i>great wealth from the depths of the
ocean</i>; and there was a tradition that he had made his fortune by
<i>diving</i>. Can any of your readers supply information upon this subject?
Was he one of the party who under Phipps (the ancestor of the house of
Mulgrave) recovered 200,000<i>l.</i> out of a Spanish vessel, sunk<a id="Page_227"></a> <span class="pagenum">[227]</span> of

<h4>
<span><i>Authorship of the Song "Oh Nanny," &amp;c.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;A question as to the
nationality, if not the authorship, of this celebrated song was
discussed (if I remember aright) not long ago in letters printed in one
of the literary periodicals, probably the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, but I
have not a reference at hand. It may be, that the facts I am about to
mention were adverted to in that discussion, and that the words are
admitted to be of English origin, and to have been written by Dr. Percy,
yet I am induced to send you this communication. In the drawing-room at
Ecton House, the mansion of Sam. Isted, Esq., at Ecton, a village about
five miles from Northampton, there was, in 1814, a portrait of the wife
of Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore (father of Mrs. Isted), holding in
her hand a scroll, on which is the celebrated song "Oh Nanny!" she being
the original, and the lines having been addressed to her before marriage
by the bishop. (<i>Account of a Tour, &amp;c., published in the Scarborough
Repository</i>, by Cole, 1824.)</p>

<p>Perhaps some correspondent of yours in that vicinity would kindly say
whether the picture remains at Ecton; or, if not, what has become of it?</p>

<span><i>Wild Oats, Origin of the Phrase.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents
favour me with the origin and definition of the phrase "To sow your wild
oats?" It has never been very clear to me why "oats" should be the grain
selected as emblematical of the dissipations and excesses of youth. They
constitute the food of the inhabitants of the poorest regions only, and
where the absence of all aid from climate and sunshine, renders almost
unceasing toil necessary, in order to obtain a meagre subsistence.</p>

<p>The "oat" appears to me so little the companion of luxury and pleasure,
that I am wholly at a loss to account for the origin of this phrase,
which is in the mouth of every one.</p>

<p>&mdash;A correspondent shows the
probability or certainty that the hitherto received opinion as to the
long confinement and death in Guernsey of this old parliamentary general
is not correct. But Mr. Hallam and others who report this, report also
that he was tried with Sir Harry Vane; and that his "submissive
behaviour" was such a contrast to that of his noble fellow-prisoner that
it perhaps influenced his sentence. Where is the proof of his behaviour
to be found? Vane's trial has been published separately. It is also in
the <i>State Trials</i>, with the trials of the regicides; but neither there
nor elsewhere can I find the trial of Lambert.</p>

<span><i>Collins the Poet, and his Ode on the Music of

</h4>

<p>&mdash;In
Seward's <i>Anecdotes of distinguished Persons</i> there is a letter from
Collins to Dr. Hayes, professor of music, Oxford, in which, after
alluding to his "Ode on the Passions," he mentions another Ode, which
appears to have been actually written.</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The subject," he states, "is <i>the Music of the Grecian Theatre</i>,
   in which," he goes on to say, "I have, I hope naturally,
   introduced the various characters with which the chorus was
   concerned, as &OElig;dipus, Medea, Electra, Orestes, &amp;c. &amp;c. The
   composition too is probably more correct, as I have chosen the
   ancient tragedies for my models, and only copied the most
   affecting passages in them."</p>


<p>The letter is dated "Chichester, November 8, 1750." Collins died in
1756. The Ode is lost; but assuredly every effort should be made to
bring it to light.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Bishop Kidder's Autobiography.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In the <i>Lives of the Bishops of Bath
and Wells</i>, by the Rev. Stephen Hyde Cassan (Rivingtons, 1829), the
greater portion of the notice there given of that learned writer and
excellent divine, Richard Kidder, bishop of that see from 1691 to 1703,
is derived from an autobiographical memoir, of which Mr. Cassan says,
"the MS., one of undoubted authority, exists in original at Wells." The
reasonable inference from this statement would be, that the MS. is in
the Cathedral Library there; but from what I have recently been able to
ascertain, through the kindness of a gentleman at Wells, it would appear
that Kidder's autobiography is not in the Cathedral Library, nor in the
hands of any individual in that place or its neighbourhood: the
probability therefore is, that it is in some private collection; and as
I believe it contains many particulars connected with the bishop's
personal history, which Mr. Cassan has passed over, I shall be glad if
any of your readers can inform me where it is to be met with. The
bishop's birthplace has been left in some doubt; it has been stated that
he was born at Lewes, at Brighthelmstone, and in Suffolk; in the memoir
referred to, the question is set at rest, for he says that he was born
at East Grinstead, Sussex, in 1633. While upon this subject I would beg
information as to the name and family of the bishop's wife, who was
killed with him in the great storm of Nov. 1703. I learn from the
baptismal registers of their children that her christian name was
<i>Elizabeth</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;Can any of your correspondents
inform me where the words originally occur, "Wise above that which is
written?" I was for a long time under the impression that they were
taken from one of St. Paul's Epistles, or at least were to be found
somewhere in the Bible; but, after having searched Cruden diligently,
though ineffectually, I am pretty sure they are not to be found in Holy
Writ.</p>

<p>I am convinced that most persons share in the opinion I formerly held,
and I have often seen them quoted in sermons just as if they were a
passage of Scripture, though, of course, without giving any reference.</p>

<h4>
<span>"<i>Hoffman</i>," <i>a Tragedy by Chettle.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any correspondent of the "N. &amp;
Q." throw any light upon the source of the plot of <i>Hoffman, a Tragedy</i>,
by Henry Chettle, 4to. 1631? The scene is laid at Dantzig in Prussia;
the hero revenges his father's death, which was caused by the Duke of
Lüneburg and other princes, by means of a red-hot iron crown placed on
his head. He kills the son of the Duke of Lüneburg in the same manner,
and assumes his character; is adopted by the Duke of Prussia, and
avenges himself by the murder of the duke, and others of his father's
judges; is finally discovered, and put to death by means of the iron
crown.</p>

<p>I have in vain searched the German chronicle of the period: from the
geographical localities being well preserved, as well as the German
names (a peculiarity in the old drama), the presumption is, that it has
been taken from an historical source. Mention is made in Menzel's
<i>History of Germany</i>, of a Count Jordan who suffered death by means of
an iron crown; and in Goldsmith's <i>Traveller</i>, the line of&mdash;</p>

  <p class="right">   "Luke's iron crown and Damon's bed of steel,"</p>


<p>is illustrated by a note in Bohn's edition of that author, of two
brothers, George and Luke Leck, who had created a rebellion in Hungary,
and of one of them suffering death in this manner; but neither of these
two cases apply at all to the subject.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Count de Vordac.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;When did the Count de Vordac, a general in the
army of the Emperor of Germany, die? His memoirs are scarce; the copy
which I have is reprinted at Paris in 1709. He was an Italian, bred for
the church, which he relinquished for the profession of arms. He was
born about 1660; his memoirs break off abruptly in 1695 when in midlife,
and he was serving under our William III. He closes his memoirs with an
account of his being at the siege of Namur, which he says cost his own
party dear, and himself more particularly. It is very probable he fell
at this siege if he continued his narrative while in the camp. His
memoirs are curious and very entertaining. I find there that he was much
esteemed at Vienna, and his conduct in rescuing the wife of one of the
German nobility from a horrible imprisonment with the corpse of the man
of whom her lord was jealous, is full of interest as well as horror,
from the mode in which it was accomplished. He was personally acquainted
with William III., who entrusted him with important commands. His
narrative makes the reader anxious to know something of his subsequent
history, if he were not a victim to the sword before the close of the
war of which he spoke.</p>

   a most valuable help to devotion, and as having had the greatest
   sale of any book ever printed in England, except the Bible. Mr.
   Hoare's name occurs in several parts of Robert Nelson's will,
   viz. "I give and bequeath to Mr. Henry Hoare, of London,

   Society:&mdash;"3d Feb. 1714-15. Mr. Hoare reported, that Mr. Nelson,
   lately deceased, had ordered him by his will, as one of his
   executors, to pay 100<i>l.</i> to the Society for promoting their
   designs; and also 50<i>l.</i> towards supporting the charity-school at
   St. George's Chapel." The name of Mr. Henry Hoare occurs among
   the list of subscribers in the first volume of Jeremy Collier's
   <i>Ecclesiastical History</i>, fol. 1708; and some of his letters to
   John Strype, the historian, will be found among the Additional
   MSS. in the British Museum, No. 5853. No biographical notice of
   Mr. Henry Hoare appears to have been preserved. See Herbert's
   <i>History of the Twelve Great Livery Companies</i>, vol. ii. p. 285.,
   for a notice of his gift to the Goldsmiths' Company.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The first edition of <i>The Whole Duty of Man</i> was published in
   1657. Like the enigmatical Junius, its authorship still remains a

   correspondent will find the question discussed in the Rev. W. B.
   Hawkins's Introduction to Pickering's edition of this work,

account of him may be met with? Also, who Wendelinus Helbachius,
Stigelius, and Bernardus Bomgardius were, whose "Disticha" are

<span><i>The "Athenian Oracle."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can you inform me who were the authors of the
"Athenian Oracle," or, in other words, the members of the "Learned
Society" who conducted this work? You may feel some interest in it as a
kind of prototype and progenitor of your own "N. &amp; Q." Your work, as I
apprehend, does not profess to solve and answer so many nice puzzling
points in divinity, philosophy, love, &amp;c., as that of the <i>Oracle</i>,
which furnishes us with a curious picture of the wants, opinions, and
manners of the age in which it appeared; but <i>yours</i>, though neither
dipping so deeply nor ranging so widely, ought to be highly prized as
the exponent of the demands of our times more improved, enlightened, and
not less inquisitive, and as affording to some of your correspondents
far from the great metropolis of letters, a ready channel for
information, much to their instruction and pleasure. Pardoning this
digression, the copy of the <i>Athenian Oracle</i> I possess is in 3 vols.
8vo., purporting to be an entire collection of all the valuable
questions and answers in the old Athenian Mercuries, &amp;c., by a member of
the Athenian Society; London, printed for Andrew Bell at the Cross Keys
and Bible in Cornhill, near Stocks Market, the second volume 1703, the
first and third 1704. The copy bears an autograph on the fly-leaf; "Ex
Libris Thomas Browne, Ex Dono plurim; M<span class="topnum">ri</span> Guil Carstairs Acad.
Edinburg. primarij professoris Cui omnia (two words obscure) Ed. Nov.
23, 1706." The historical celebrity of Carstairs is a <i>small feather in

of the book and its authors, the former having often supplied much
rational fireside entertainment.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">[<i>The Athenian Gazette</i>, afterwards called <i>The Athenian

   vols. 8vo. The fourth volume contains a Supplement, to which is
   prefixed "The History of the Athenian Society," and an "Essay
   upon Learning." It was projected by the celebrated John Dunton,
   who says, "My first project was the <i>Athenian Gazette</i>. As the
   Athenian Society had their first meeting in my brain, so it has
   been kept ever since religiously secret: but I will now oblige
   the reader with a true discovery of the <i>question-project</i>, and

   were occasionally assisted by Dr. Norris. The work was also
   countenanced by several of the most eminent writers of the age;
   and was honoured in particular with a commendatory poem by Swift.

<h3>
<span>GRIMESDYKE.<br />
(Vol. iv. <i>passim.</i>)</span>
</h3>

<p>N<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTICUS</span> is informed that in Norfolk one of the hundreds, or
subdivisions of the county, is called <i>Grimshoo</i> or <i>Grimshow</i>, after
(as it is supposed) a Danish leader of the name of <i>Grime</i> or <i>Gryme</i>.
He was undoubtedly either <i>Præsitus Comitatus</i> or <i>Centuriæ Præpositus</i>
of that part of the country, and gave his name to the hundred as
hundred-greeve, which name it still retains. In about the centre of this
hundred is a very curious Danish encampment, in a semicircular form,
consisting of about twelve acres.</p>

<p>In this space are a great number of large deep pits, joined in a regular
manner, one near to another, in form of a quincunx, the largest in the
centre, where the general's or commander's tent was placed. These pits
are so deep and numerous as to be able to conceal a very great army. At
the east end of this entrenchment is a large tumulus, pointing towards
Thetford, from which it is about five or six miles distant; and which
might possibly have served as a watch tower, or place of signal: and
here the hundred court used to be called. This place also is known by
the name of <i>The Holes</i>, or <i>Grimes-graves</i>. This part of the country,
being open, was a great seat of war between the Saxons and Danes, as
appears from many tumuli throughout this hundred, erected over the
graves of leaders who fell in battle; or as tokens of victory, to show
how far they had led their armies and conquered.&mdash;See <i>Blomfield</i> in
loco.</p>

   <p class="right">  J. F. F.</p>

  <p class="left"> West Newton.</p>


<p>To the various instances already recorded in "N. &amp; Q.," of ancient
earthworks having received the name "Grimesdyke," the following may be
added.</p>

<p>One on Cranbourne Chase, Dorset; three in Berkshire, viz., one near
Silchester, one near Oare, where also are Grimsbury, and Grimsbury
Forest; another, intersected by the Thames, near Wallingford; another
near Witney, Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>The great fossa and vallum of Lollius Urbicus in Scotland, is called
Graham's and Grime's Dyke. The frequency of its application to various
earthworks in such distant parts of the kingdom may perhaps be
considered sufficient evidence that the name is not derived from that of
any landed proprietor, as suggested by one of your correspondents. I
have no doubt the derivation suggested by your first correspondent,
N<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTICUS</span>, is the true one, viz., that it is of Saxon origin, signifying
Wizard, or the Evil Spirit, which indicates, not only that these
earthworks were in existence in Saxon times, but that their origin was
even then so remote and mysterious that they were supposed to be the
work of supernatural agency. Grimesdyke, described by N<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTICUS</span> as
beginning near Berkhamsted, Herts (not Hants, as misprinted in "N. &amp;
Q."), and running across the Chiltern hills, is mentioned, <i>temp.</i> Henry
III., in a charter of Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, granting Ashridge to the
fraternity of the Bonhommes:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Usque ad quoddam fossatum quod dicitur Grymesdich."</p>


<p>If this should meet the eyes of my friend N<span class="smcap lowercase">AUTICUS</span>, wherever in the
broad seas he may happen to be, he will be glad to hear that this
extensive earthwork of antiquity is now undergoing the investigation of
an Archæological Society, of which he is an esteemed member. I may
further remark that the family name of Grimesdike is doubtless from some
ancient place so named, and not these several places from the family.
The armorial bearings of the family would at once suggest this
conclusion. I have not found the name given to any ancient work in
Wales, which of course would not be the case, if it be of Saxon origin.</p>

<h3>
<span>JOHNSON'S HOUSE, BOLT COURT.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 176.)</span>
</h3>

<p>A correspondent discussing the question of the site, or of the continued
existence, of the house in Bolt Court in which Johnson lived and died,
mentions that one person now living called there during the last illness
of our sublime moralist. I believe he refers to Mr. Rogers.</p>

<p>The fact is that there is also a lady, an inhabitant of Piccadilly,
Viscountess Keith, who not only grew from childhood to the age of twenty
in the constant association of the Doctor, but who is also mentioned by
Madame D'Arblay as having been a visitor at Bolt Court in 1784. Whether
the noble lady referred to, at the extraordinary age she has reached
(she was the eldest Miss Thrale), could solve from memory your friend's
doubts as to this classical locality, I know not.</p>

<p class="right">  M. A.</p>


<p>I am in a position to assure M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">DWIN</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">ECHLADE</span> that Dr. Johnson's house
was burnt down in 1819, the premises having been long previously
occupied by the most eminent English printer of his own or any other
time, Mr. Thomas Bensley, to whose energy the world is indebted for the
perfection of the printing machine.</p>

<p>The house of Johnson's friend, Mr. Allen the printer, was not destroyed
by the disastrous fire which reduced to ashes the Doctor's residence;
indeed only one corner of it was injured; and, with that exception, it
stands as it was built shortly after the Great Fire of London.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen's house stands at the head of Bolt Court; Dr. Johnson's stood
to its left. On the site of the latter was erected, after the
before-mentioned fire, a spacious printing-office, and both are now in
the occupation of Mr. Tyler.</p>

<p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (1819, part i., p. 575.), in giving an
account of this fire, says in a note:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"It may be interesting to some of our readers to know that the
   house in Bolt Court, formerly the residence of Dr. Johnson,
   formed part of Mr. Bensley's office, and is now entirely
   destroyed. A view of it is preserved in the <i>European Magazine</i>
   for 1810."</p>


<p>The <i>European Magazine</i> (1810, vol. lvii. pp. 353-4.) contains, besides
the view above-mentioned, an article to which your correspondent may be
referred, in confirmation of the fact that the house occupied by Dr.
Johnson was the one I have referred to, and was not exactly opposite the
"Dr. Johnson tavern." The view, I am told by one who well recollects the
old house, and is a great lover of Johnsoniana, is a correct
representation of it.</p>

<p>Timperley's <i>Dictionary of Printers and Printing</i>, also, in relating the
occurrence of the fire of Messrs. Bensley's premises, states that a part
of it was formerly the residence of Dr. Johnson.</p>

 <p class="right">  T<span class="smcap lowercase">EE</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">EE</span>.</p>

<p>In answer to the Query of E<span class="smcap lowercase">DWIN</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">ECHLADE</span>, being in a position to give
you unquestionable information, I will, to quote your correspondent's
words, let the question be set at rest. Of the<a id="Page_233"></a> <span class="pagenum">[233]</span> house in which Dr.
Johnson lived and died, not one brick is left upon another. It was
destroyed totally by fire in 1819; and the partywall between that and
Mr. Allen's house alone remains, being the west wall of that large
residence. When up Bolt Court, you turn to the left through an iron gate
leading to a flight of stone steps to the printing-office now occupied
by Mr. Tyler, and <i>where those stone steps are</i>, stood the doctor's
residence. I know of no relic that was saved except the <i>scraper</i>, which
was distorted into a curious shape by the action of the fire, and being
firmly fixed in a heavy stone, it lay about the yard for years.</p>

<p>The late well-known printer Mr. Bensley succeeded Mr. Allen there in
business in 1783, going at once to reside in his house <i>next door</i> to
Dr. Johnson, whom, of course, as a close neighbour, he often saw, and
whose funeral he witnessed. After the Doctor's death the
Rev.&mdash;Stockdale, of the Church of England, occupied the house; next to
him it was tenanted by a Rev.&mdash;Moir, (I believe) a Presbyterian; next,
by one Copley, an old tailor, whom I have teased many times when a boy;
for some of us youngsters having overheard him once in a soliloquy
groaning, "Dear me&mdash;and the buttons all wrong!" on passing him it became
a <i>mot</i> among us expressed sufficiently loud to reach his ears, when he
would look unutterable things. He was a worthy but somewhat cross old
man, in very respectable circumstances. His was the last family which
ever occupied the premises as a dwelling-house; I knew him there for
about twenty years. During his abode the freehold was put up for sale by
auction, as well as of Allen's house; Mr. Bensley purchased both. This
was somewhere about 1804-1807. But as Copley had a lease, he did not
vacate till about 1814, when Mr. Bensley appropriated the two houses to
his printing purposes (and there, it may not be unworthy of notice, was
steam-printing first practised),&mdash;so occupied the said premises were,
till destroyed by fire in 1819. Mr. Bensley's eldest surviving son
succeeded him in 1820, but did not, in re-constructing the premises,
build on the site of Dr. Johnson's house, though <i>a part</i> thereof has
since been covered. The map&mdash;a very fragile, worm-eaten affair&mdash;shows
the exact dimensions of the house, the place where the walls stood, &amp;c.
The property remains in Mr. Bensley's family. I have often heard Mr.
Bensley describe the Doctor and his funeral.</p>

<p>The print in the <i>European Magazine</i> is an accurate representation of
the appearance of this ancient and gloomy house in the dark corner; but
it had many comforts, and "a large garden," in which I have been; it is
now all built upon, and has been covered for nearly half a century. Some
yet living may have visited Dr. Johnson there: I have often conversed
with others who are dead that did&mdash;the late Mr. Bowyer Nichols, Mr.
Cradock (of Leicestershire), Mr. A. Strahan, and others mentioned in the
Doctor's works, when gratifying their curiosity by showing them over the
house; and it has fallen to my lot to do so to many literary characters.
Indeed as to the place where Dr. Johnson lived and died, there is no
more room for doubt than as to where old London bridge stood. I have
many times been with the late Mr. James Boswell (son of Dr. Johnson's
biographer) in the rather dismal parlour&mdash;which spot, it is not to be
wondered at, had a peculiar attraction for <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>There is <i>no</i> kind of foundation for assigning Dr. Johnson's residence
to that where Cobbett lived or wrote&mdash;it was a mere joke. As to the
"Johnson's Head" tavern, it was an upholsterer's manufactory at the time
of Dr. Johnson's death. I myself knew an old man of the name of <i>Hale</i>
residing in it, and carrying on that occupation so early as 1800, who
had doubtless been there before Dr. Johnson's death; his son followed
him, and continued till about 1826-1830 in those premises. By the same
token (as Paddy says), while now addressing "N. &amp; Q." (though nearly 300
miles from the spot) I am writing at a table Hale sen. made for me in
that house in 1818.</p>

<p>The greater part of Mr. Bensley's extensive premises was <i>twice</i> burned
down; but on neither occasion was Allen's house destroyed. It yet
stands, though so altered and improved as not to resemble the original
edifice. Mr. Tyler's counting-house, by the iron gate at the S. W.
corner, however, is left just as used by Allen (except a passage cut off
at the end), the panelling, &amp;c., just the same, being the <i>only</i> part
remaining unaltered: there was then, of course, no door out to the stone
steps, as there stood Dr. Johnson's parlour. In this counting-house, no
doubt, Dr. Johnson often was; and in the adjoining parlour he often fed.
It was a very old-fashioned room, as I well remember it upwards of half
a century ago. His better parlour, or drawing-room, was large and
handsomely furnished for the period, with three windows, and two ancient
pier-glasses fixed to tables, gilt and adorned according to the taste of
the times. Mr. Bensley bought these and a few other household matters,
which remained <i>in statu quo</i> till 1805-1808.</p>

<p>I have seen some prints of the inside of Dr. Johnson's house, which do
not give a very accurate idea of the appearance of the rooms, &amp;c.; but,
I repeat it, the view of the front in the <i>European Magazine</i> is
excellent.</p>

<p>The celebrity of Dr. Johnson may induce you to insert this, which,
without that influence, I am aware would be too tedious.</p>

<h3>
<span>COOPER'S MINIATURE OF CROMWELL.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 368.; Vol. v., p. 189. &amp;c.)</span>
</h3>

<p>It is only within a few months that the existence of the "N. &amp; Q."
became known to me. It seemed likely to be such an useful and amusing
publication, from the description I received of it from a literary
friend (now appointed vice-consul to the Isle of Mytilene), that I lost
no time in becoming a subscriber; and I am rejoiced to add, that my
expectations have not been disappointed, though I have not had time to
read the Notes or attend to the Queries as fully as I could have wished
till very lately.</p>

<p>However, I have now observed amongst the Replies, Vol. v., p. 189., a
Note relating to the miniature of Cromwell by Cooper, with several
references to other Notes and Queries upon the same subject, originating
with a Query from L<span class="smcap lowercase">ORD</span> B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span> in Vol. iv., p. 368. If the following
appears to you worthy of insertion, pray use it.</p>

<p>I have a beautiful miniature of Oliver Cromwell, painted with very great
care, and which has every appearance of being an original by Cooper. I
remember it all my life in my father's (Lord Holland's) room at Holland
House; and on his death in 1840, it was left by him to his friend and
mine, John Allen, late master of Dulwich College, who died in 1843, and
left it with his books to me.</p>

<p>Cromwell is painted in armour, with a remarkably clean, plain,
turned-down shirt collar; his usual countenance, somewhat stern, but
full of the expression of good sense and intelligence; reddish hair, and
a small portion of it under the lower lip. On the back is written in my
father's handwriting:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"This miniature was given to me when at school by Lady Diana
   Beauclerk, who assured me that it was an original by Cooper, and
   that it had been long in the possession of the Beauclerk family,
   who had it from Charles II. (Signed) <span class="smcap lowercase">VASSALL HOLLAND</span>."</p>


<p>Lady D. Beauclerk, herself distinguished as an artist, was the daughter
of the Duke of St. Albans, a lineal descendant of Charles II.</p>

<p>There is an engraving from a miniature of Cromwell in Carlyle's life of
him, said to be in the possession of Archdeacon Berners, which I believe
to be also by Cooper. It is larger than mine, and even better painted. I
have seen it, but cannot recollect where or when.</p>

 <p class="right"> C. Fox, Major-General.</p>


<p>P.S.&mdash;I have left my miniature with my friend Mr. Domenic Colnaghi at
Pall Mall East, for the inspection of any of your correspondents. It
will be there till the <i>31st March</i>.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE QUEEN OF THE ISLE OF MAN.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 132.)</span>
</h3>


<p>In an interesting communication from M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. W<span class="smcap lowercase">M</span>. S<span class="smcap lowercase">IDNEY</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span> in a late
Number of your publication there occurs the following statement, to
which I beg to add a few remarks. He says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"After the death of Magnus, the island was seized by Alexander
   III. of Scotland. A daughter and heiress of Reginald sued for it
   against John Baliol, before Edward I. of England, as lord
   paramount of Man.</p>

<p class="author1"> "<i>Rot. Parl.</i>, 31 Edw. I."</p>


<p>And farther on he states:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"From sundry records it appears that Edward II. and Edward III.
   committed its custody to various persons, and the latter at
   length conferred his right to it upon William Montacute, Earl of
   Salisbury, in consideration, probably, of that valiant earl
   having by his arms regained the island from the Scots, who had
   resumed possession, and of the circumstance that his grandmother,
   the wife of Simon de Montacute, was sister and heiress of one of
   the former kings of Man, and related to the lady who had claimed
   it as her inheritance on the death of Magnus."</p>


<p>Now, I think M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> G<span class="smcap lowercase">IBSON</span>, on reflection, will agree with me in concluding
that the wife of Simon de Montacute, and the lady who claimed the island
on the death of Magnus, were one and the same person. There is no
document, I believe, of the kind he refers to, of the "31st" of Edw. I.;
but in the "21st" of Edw. I., which date is probably intended, there is
amongst the Scotch Rolls (anno 21 Edw. I. m. 4.) a citation from Edward
I., as supreme lord of Scotland, directed to John Baliol, King of Scots,
to answer the complaint of <i>Aufrica</i>, cousin and heiress of Magnus, late
King of Man, &amp;c. This is in the year 1292-3; and a few years later we
again meet with <i>Aufrica</i>, for amongst the ancient charters in the
British Museum is one marked "V. 73." It is a deed by which "<i>Aufrica</i>,
heiress of the land of Man," gives up her right therein "to her noble
and potent husband, Simon de Montagu." This deed is dated at
Bridgewater, on Thursday the Vigil of the Annunciation, 1305; <i>i.e.</i>
March 24, 1306.</p>

<p>In this charter (V. 73.) she calls herself <i>Aufrica de Connought</i>: and
this is rather curious, for in a volume of pedigrees in the British
Museum, in the handwriting of Robert Glover, Somerset Herald (Bib. Harl.
807.), she is said to be the daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galloway
(Galway?), and Queen of Man. <i>Galway</i> it is in another MS. in the same
collection (MSS. Harl. 1074. folio 22.), where she is styled "Aufrica,
Reyne de Man," and daughter of Fergus, Lord of Galway. In both these
MSS. she is said to be the wife of Simon de Montagu, who is styled "Roy
de Man par sa femme."</p>

<p>&mdash;The following quotation from a
"Dissertation on Scottish Music," by Mr. Tytler, of Woodhouselee (the
grandfather of the historian), contained in the <i>Transactions of the
Society of Scottish Antiquaries</i>, vol. i. p. 486., although not an
answer to his Query, may perhaps prove interesting to J.M.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"To the wandering harpers we are certainly indebted for that
   species of music which is now scarcely known, I mean <i>the Port</i>.
   Almost every great family had a <i>Port</i> that went by the name of
   the family. Of the few that are still preserved are, <i>Port
   Lennox</i>, <i>Port Gordon</i>, <i>Port Seton</i>, and <i>Port Athole</i>, which
   are all of them excellent in their kind. The <i>Port</i> is not of the
   martial strain of the <i>march</i>, as some have conjectured; those
   above named being all in the plaintive strain, and modulated for
   the harp.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "The <i>pibroch</i>, the march or battle-tune of the <i>Highland clans</i>,
   with the different strains introduced of the <i>coronich</i>, &amp;c., is
   fitted for the <i>bagpipe</i> only: its measure, in the <i>pas grave</i> of
   the <i>Highland piper</i>, equipped with his flag and military
   ensigns, when marching up to battle, is stately and animating,

<p>&mdash;The "unnatural
gait" which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. L<span class="smcap lowercase">AWRENCE</span> inquires about, is known in Spain as the "paso
Castiliano;" and supplies the place of the more familiar trot, which the
Spanish horses are rarely broken into.</p>

<p>I did not see the piece of plate alluded to, but probably the horse was
a Spanish (Andalusian) jennet, which would account for the peculiarity
of the pace. I cannot explain how this step is taught, but Spanish
horses fall into it at once on being touched with the spur, and
simultaneously curbed; and they perform long journeys thus, at the rate
of five miles an hour, with little fatigue to themselves or their
riders. Does not the dromedary also <i>pace</i> in the same way?</p>

<p>&mdash;M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. R<span class="smcap lowercase">ELTON'S</span> supposition that
the word <i>stickle</i> is used for a <i>pool</i>, is at variance with the common
usage of the word in Devonshire, where only I have met with it. It is
there used to describe the shallow swift running water immediately below
a pool. It is thus equivalent to the word <i>rapids</i>. It is by no means
obsolete, or a mere technical term of the "patient anglers." The
opposition in the line quoted, "Near to some <i>stickle</i> or <i>deep</i> bay,"
would alone have been a good reason to doubt whether it could be the
same as <i>pool</i>.</p>

questions, and profited by the answer, find additional answer, or better
answer, by their subsequent researches. As one of these, in reference to
my Query about Latin names of towns in Vol. i., I mention the list given
in Riccioli's <i>Geographia et Hydrographiæ Reformatæ</i>, of which the first
edition was licensed in 1658 (I don't know where it was printed), and
the record is of Venice, folio, 1672. This work contains, from more than

<p class="blockquot"> "There are several copper mines conducted here with great
   success. In October, 1849, the miners in the course of their
   labours, broke into an immense cavern, the roof of which, being
   one mass of stalactite, reflected back their lights with dazzling
   splendour. On examination the work turned out to be an ancient
   work, probably Roman, the benches, stone hammers, &amp;c. used by
   that ancient people, having been found entire, together with many
   bones of mutton. The bones were to all appearance as fresh,
   though impregnated with copper, as they were when denuded of

   nearly 2000 years in the bowels of the earth. The cavern is about

<span><i>Passage in Troilus and Cressida</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 178.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In reply to your
correspondent W. S. D. I have only to say, that my folio of 1632, with
early manuscript emendations, does not contain any alteration of the
line in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, Act I. Sc. 3.:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Peaceful commerce from dividable shores;"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">which seems to me quite intelligible without any change. In the next
line it reads "primogeniture" for "primogeni<i>tive</i>", and as I apprehend
rightly, the concluding syllable <i>tive</i> having been caught by the
compositor from "prerogative," the first word in the line immediately
below it.<a id="Page_236"></a> <span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>I may take this opportunity of saying that no play in my volume is more
patiently corrected than <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>; and that in a preceding
speech by Nestor it confirms a correction by Theobald in the first
line&mdash;god<i>like</i> for "godly;" and by Sir Thomas Hanmer in the last
line&mdash;<i>replies</i> for "retires." Malone printed <i>returns</i> after Pope,
which answers the sense very well, but is hardly so probable a misprint.
I am sorry to say that I thought otherwise when I published my
Shakspeare; and I never can sufficiently regret that this corrected copy
of the second folio did not fall into my hands until some years after I
had completed that undertaking.</p>

Dunham parva in Norfolk, and who was the great-grandfather of the naval
hero, was the son of <i>Edmund</i> Nelson of Scarning, in the same county,
and grandson of <i>Thomas</i> of the same place, which Thomas, according to
the same pedigree, was the son of another William, who is stated to have
been a Nelson of Mandesley, the same family from which the Chuddleworth
Nelsons are derived in Burke's account. I have tested the general
accuracy of this pedigree, which was, I believe, compiled by Mr. Matcham
from the parochial registers, but I much doubt the assumed descent from
the Mandesley family, as I find Nelsons inhabiting the neighbourhood of
Scarning at a period prior to the supposed migration.</p>

<span><i>Maps of Africa</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 174.).</span>

<p>&mdash;I have been intending for some
time to write to you on the same subject as <i>Paterfamiliæ</i>, but the
Christian grace of laziness has been too strong for me. <i>Paterfamiliæ</i>,
however, has aroused me. My case is this: five years ago I commenced a
map, for my own use, of the shores of the Mediterranean, and such
countries as received Christianity up to the period of the Council of
Nice; and I had a hope of eventually being able to carry out the plan
suggested by D<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">AITLAND</span>, in his work on the Dark Ages, and an
intention of making mysterious marks to indicate the scene of any great
persecution, remarkable synod, or other notable event. Well! I got on
very well, by the help of Kiepert and Cramer, through Greece, Asia
Minor, and Italy. Indeed, I managed to be content with all my sources,
as far as Europe was concerned; but when I had advanced as far as North
Africa, I came to a dead stop. There really was absolutely no map that I
could find that I could trust for the site of Carthage or Alexandria.
There were no "N. &amp; Q." when I found myself at a stand-still; but I
asked all the friends about me, and I verily believe that to the
majority of those I spoke to it appeared an unreasonable thing for any
man to expect a map of the regions I wanted described. There seemed a
kind of feeling that when a man had got a map of Caffraria and Egypt,
and perhaps knew where Algiers <i>might</i> be, he knew quite as much about
Africa as he ought. Can any of your correspondents now help me? Is there
no authentic <i>French</i> map of at least some portion of the coast; or is
there any map in existence among ourselves that is not palpably a "fancy
portrait?"</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Passage in Hamlet</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 169.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I have just read A. E. B.'s
Notes on Shakspeare, No. II. His long criticism, ending in his own
suggestion of a new reading of the passage in <i>Hamlet</i>, does not
convince me that he has found the true reading yet. I suggest the
following:</p>

<div class="poem">

                     <p class="i5"> "The dram of base</p>
      <p>Doth all the noble substance often <i>dull</i>,</p>
      <p>To his own scandal."</p>
</div>

<p>This reading of mine only makes it necessary to substitute the letters
<i>n</i> and <i>ll</i>, for <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>, in the quarto of 1605.</p>

<p><i>Dull</i> is a favourite word of Shakspeare's; and surely it makes at least
as good sense as any of the other readings. It is questionable whether
the lines are Shakspeare's; for the whole passage, from "This
heavy-headed revel," to "To his own scandal," is omitted in the first
and second folios, and also in the first known quarto of "1603."</p>

<p>To prove how easy it is for printers, or copiers from original
manuscripts of authors, to make mistakes, I will call your attention to
a serious blunder in the <i>first edition</i> of Ben Jonson's verses
addressed to the Earl of Somerset, which are in the <i>Athenæum</i> of Feb.
21st. The twenty-first and twenty-second lines are thus printed:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "So in theyr number may you neuer see</p>

<span>(Vol. v., p. 178.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I suspect Mr. Bush's proposed collection was never
published. In an old MS. account of the Fellows of King's, I find the
following extract. I copy it as it stands:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"1718.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Cha. Bush, of Harmondsworth, Middx. Res on being denied his
   Degree of A. B. in College from Party.... A Clk. of the Record
   Off. in the Tower, 1725. April 27, 1726, he published <i>proposals
   for printing by Subsr</i>. A lott of Charters and Letters Patent,
   and other Instruments concerning the Creation and Investiture of
   the eldest sons of the K<span class="topnum">s</span> of Engl. as Princes of Wales, D. of
   Cornwall &amp; E. of Chester &amp; Flint, together with several Extracts
   out of the Parl. Rolls relating to the Honor, Dignity, &amp; Estate
   of the P. of Wales, from the time of Edward first, P. of Wales
   (afterwards K. E. 2) to the time of E. 4. inclusive, faithfully
   collated from the Records of the Tower by C. B. one of the Clks.
   of the Record Off. in the T. &amp; late Fell. of K. C. C.</p>

<p class="blockquot">"He was taken into the Ordnance Office to assist in methodising
   the Papers belonging to it, and was after Sec. to the Board of
   Ordnance."</p>


<p>It would seem Mr. Bush's proposals did not meet with a favourable
reception, or perhaps his removal to an important government office
prevented his fulfilling his intentions. It is to be hoped he returned
his subscriptions (if any).</p>

<span><i>Litera scripta manet</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 200.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The following extract, if
not complete answer to the query on <i>Litera scripta manet</i>, is a curious
instance of the early use of that maxim, and I transcribe it with
pleasure as a specimen of one of the best informed and most interesting
of our medieval prose writers. I rely, as to orthography and
punctuation, on Joseph Ames:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Considering that wordes ben perisshyng, wayne, and forgateful,
   and wrytynes duelle and abide permanent, as I rede, <i>Vox audita
   perit, litera scripta manet</i>. Thise thinges have caused that the
   faites and deeds of auncient men ben sette by declaracion in fair
   and aourned volumes, to thende that science and artes, lerned and
   founden, of thinges passed might be had in perpetuel memorye and
   remembraunce," &amp;c.</p>

<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p><i>The Athenæum</i> of Saturday the 21st February announces that Sir F.
Madden has secured for the British<a id="Page_238"></a> <span class="pagenum">[238]</span> Museum the celebrated "Bedford
Missal," and several other beautiful MSS., by the wise expenditure of
three thousand pounds. The other MSS., not described by <i>The Athenæum</i>,
are, we believe, the <i>Breviary of Isabella of Spain</i>, presented to her
by Francisco de Rojas in 1497, on the occasion of the double marriage of
her children, Don Juan and Do&ntilde;a Juana, to Margaret of Austria and Philip
the Fair, which sold at Mr. Hurd's sale in 1832 for 520<i>l.</i>; the <i>Hours
of Juana of Castile</i>, wife of Philip the Fair, formerly in Hanrott's
library; the <i>Hours of Francis I.</i>, which sold in Sir Mark Masterman
Sykes's sale, 1824, for 163<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>; the <i>Hours of François
d'Inteville</i>, Bishop of Auxerre, executed in 1525, formerly in
Beckford's collection; another volume of <i>Hours</i> of the sixteenth
century, and a fine copy, in two large vols. folio, of the French
translation of Petrus Comestor's <i>Historia Scholastica</i>, by Guiart des
Molins, completed in 1294. While we agree with our contemporary in our
approval of this purchase, we cannot help adding to that approval a hope
that neither the trustees nor the treasury will make this expenditure an
excuse for not enabling the keeper of the MSS. to make extensive
purchases at the sales of valuable historical collections which are
expected to take place in the course of the present year.</p>

<p>At a general meeting of the Percy Society held last Thursday week, the
dissolution of the Society was determined on; and the meeting came to
the very proper resolution of not selling the stock of books in hand,
which would have had the effect of depreciating the market-value of the
Society's publications, but of distributing them among the existing
members. It is proposed, we believe, to form a new Society on a somewhat
similar plan; but which is to have for its object the reprinting,
without abridgment or omission, of such rare but well chosen tracts by
Greene, Nash Breton, Taylor the Water Poet, &amp;c. as afford valuable
illustration of manners, or are interesting in any other point of view.</p>

<p>We have received from Messrs. Rivington a new volume containing <i>Eight
Essays on Various Subjects</i>, by the Rev. S. R. Maitland, D.D. The pages
of "N. &amp; Q." have been so frequently enriched by contributions from the
able pen of the writer of these Essays, and he has in the work in
question spoken so kindly of this journal, that we feel it will be more
respectful to one who does not need our praise&mdash;which might under these
circumstances be attributed to interested motives&mdash;if we limit our
notice of the subject of the volume to an enumeration of the titles of
the essays. They are as follows:&mdash;I. <i>On the Mystical Interpretation of
Scripture</i>; II. <i>Sacred Art</i>&mdash;No. 1. <i>Music</i>; III. <i>Sacred Art</i>&mdash;No. 2.
<i>Painting</i>; IV. <i>Matter of Fact</i>; V. <i>The Fulness of the Gentiles</i>; VI.
<i>The Waldenses and Albigenses</i>; VII. <i>Perrin's History of the Vaudois</i>;
VIII. <i>The Lollards</i>. When we add that to these are appended the
following notes:&mdash;A. <i>Cowper's Nightcap</i>; B. <i>Vauxhall</i>; C. <i>The School
of Declamation</i>; D. <i>On Political Prophecies</i>; E. <i>The "Mirabilis Liber"
and "Petrus de Bardis"</i>; F. <i>Extracts from Lollard Prophecies</i>: we think
we have shown all who know the learning, honesty of purpose, strong
common sense, and racy humour of the Essayist, that the book is one to
be looked after, and to be looked at.</p>

<p class="noindent cap">A NEW GENERAL BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY. Projected and partly arranged by
the late Rev. HUGH JAMES ROSE, B.D., Principal of King's College,
London.</p>

<p>This work is intended to supply a deficiency in our literature which has
existed since the completion of Mr. Chalmers's Biographical Dictionary,
in 1817. That publication, now nearly obsolete, contained less than 9000
names, while the present Work contains more than 20,000. It has been
most carefully edited and compiled by experienced writers, who have
availed themselves of the vast body of materials which domestic and
foreign literature has of late years supplied. The great variety and
extensive range of its contents, far exceeding those of any other modern
biographical publication in our language, must render it a very
important addition to every public and private Library, both as a work
of reference, and a storehouse of information and amusement for all
classes of readers.</p>
